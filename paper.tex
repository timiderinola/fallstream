% If the full title of your paper is short enough to also fit in the running head, you can omit the abbreviated paper title here. You can check as follows: if you comment out the \titlerunning line, something will appear in the header of all odd-numbered pages of your PDF from page 3 onward. This something is either the full title (in which case all is well), or the error message "Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length". If this error message appears, you're going to want to provide an abbreviated title within the \titlerunning command, because if you won't do it, Springer will do it for you.

%N.B.: Author information (both in the \author{} and \authorrunning{} command) should only be present in the Camera-Ready Version of your paper. The version that you initially submit for review, ought to be double-blind. So, when initially submitting your paper, use:

% You may leave out the orcidID information, if you want to.
% Use \corr to indicate the corresponding author. Note the spacing around the \corr command. Only one author can be the corresponding author.

%N.B.: comment out the \authorrunning{} command for the double-blind version of your paper submitted for review. Later, if your paper is accepted, use the command for the Camera-Ready Version.

\begin{abstract}
Falls pose a significant health risk, particularly for older adults and individuals with medical conditions. While most existing research focuses on detecting falls after they occur, proactive approaches such as fall risk assessments are too infrequent to capture daily mobility fluctuations. This paper introduces a novel real-time fall probability framework that leverages real-world mobility and fall data and state-of-the-art time series techniques for fall detection in streaming mode. The proposed method eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and operates with high computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate the potential for real-world implementation, offering a step toward more effective fall management strategies.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Main Contributions}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\section{Related Work}
In this section, we discuss recent approaches to fall intervention, namely, reactive approaches, and proactive approaches. While reactive approaches focus on detecting falls as soon as possible after it happens to enable quick response and management, proactive approaches focus on taking measures to prevent falls altogether.
\subsection{Reactive Approaches}
\subsection{Proactive Approaches}
% \subsection{Basket Weaving}
% \subsubsection{Underwater Basket Weaving} Only two levels of
% headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
% they are formatted as run-in headings.

% \paragraph{Underwater Basket Weaving Under Difficult Circumstances}
% The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
% headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}[t]

tables.}\label{tab1}

1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.

\section{Experiments}
% POST-PROCESS CLASSIFIER OUTPUT USING EXPERT KNOWLEDGE
    % it is acceptable to have a tolerance of 10 seconds before and after the window 
    % Use cohort-based splitting to avoid having subjects in both train and testing
    % Have some rules about how close detected falls can be
% 1. Discuss data
% 2. Preprocessing, segmentation, etc
% 3. Fall prediction--how far back can we go before the classifier begins to fail completely?
% First step, leave test data as before, augment training with ADLs
% 4. Detecting when we enter that window.
% 5. Effects of personalisation
% 5. Testing on another dataset--mobiliseD

\section{Discussion}

\section{Conclusion}

Of course, authors have complete freedom on how they choose to structure their paper. Section headers from Introduction up to and including Conclusions are completely up to the discretion of the authors; use whichever structure you see fit. Title, Abstract, the credits environment, and References, however, are mandatory.

\begin{credits}
\subsubsection{\ackname} A bold run-in heading in small font size at the end of the paper is
used for general acknowledgments, for example: This study was funded
by X (grant number Y).

\subsubsection{\discintname}
It is now necessary to declare any competing interests or to specifically
state that the authors have no competing interests. Please place the
statement with a bold run-in heading in small font size beneath the
(optional) acknowledgments,
for example: The authors have no competing interests to declare that are
relevant to the content of this article. Or: Author A has received research
grants from Company W. Author B has received a speaker honorarium from
Company X and owns stock in Company Y. Author C is a member of committee Z.

% ---- Bibliography ----
%
% BibTeX users should specify bibliography style 'splncs04'.
% References will then be sorted and formatted in the correct style.
%
% \bibliographystyle{splncs04}
% \bibliography{mybibliography}
%% Note that this preceding line implies that you store your BibTeX references in a file called 'mybibliography.bib'. If you instead store your references in a file with a different name, for instance 'references.bib', the preceding line should read '\bibliography{references}'. Whatever you do, DO NOT put the file name extension .bib inside the \bibliography command; this will trip up LaTeX compilers. 
%
% If you do not want to use BibTeX, you can also type up the bibliography exactly as you see fit, using the following structure:
\begin{thebibliography}{8}
% Note that this number 8 reserves an amount of space (equal to the natural width of the given number) for the label of your references; if you have more than 9 references, you will want to change this number to 18. If you have more than 19 references, this number is best changed to 88. If you have more than 99 references, I salute you.
